<p> The dictionary defines context as <i>"The circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed."*</i> Applying this definition to software development, there is a great deal of context that is needed for a developer to fully understand a task. However, there is little research on what type of context is needed for a developer to complete a task, how we can model context around a task, and how we can use those models in software development at large. This workshop aims at identifying and modeling context in software development, as well as discussing its application. Papers may address issues along the broad topics, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Types of context in software development </li>
  <li> Modeling context in software development </li> 
  <li> Application of context in software development </li>
  <li> Using context to support implicit or explicit coordination </li>
  <li> Context in requirements engineering </li>
  <li> Context in testing and maintenance </li>
  <li> Context in collaborative activities such as bug triaging </li>
  <li> Context in development processes, e.g. agile processes </li>
  <li> Software project managers view on context </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="submission" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submission</h3>

<p>We invite two kinds of submissions: 5-page long papers and 2-page short papers. A selection of papers will be presented at the workshop.

At the time of submission all papers must conform to the <a href="http://2015.icse-conferences.org/submission-guidelines" >ICSE 2015 Formatting and Submission Guidelines</a>.
