<a name="cfp" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>There is little research on defining what context is, how we can model it, and how we can use those models in software development at large. This workshop aims at identifying and modeling context in software development, as well as discussing its application. Papers may address issues along the broad topics, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Types of context in software development </li>
  <li> Modeling context in software development </li> 
  <li> Application of context in software development </li>
  <li> Using context to support implicit coordination </li>
  <li> Context in requirements engineering </li>
  <li> Context in testing and maintenance </li>
  <li> Context in collaborative activities such as bug triaging </li>
  <li> Context in agile processes </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="submission" class="anchor"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Submission</h3>

<p>We will invite two kinds of submissions: 5-page papers and 2-page position papers. A selection of selected papers will be presented at the workshop.
<br><br>
Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation and appropriate comparison to related work. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the workshop. 
Submissions will be accepted electronically through EasyChair.
<br><br>
Papers are intended as positions for discussion and not for archival publication, so they will not appear in the ACM Digital Library.
