<p>The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in techniques and tools that leverage context information around development activities for better support of software development activities. 
In large and complex software projects, developers must manage a large amount of context to complete their development tasks including the relevant software artifacts and their change history, requirements, design specifications, dependent tasks, concurrent work, discussions and knowledge exchanges about those tasks and artifacts, and more. In fact, context in software development is multifaceted, and what information is relevant as context for a developer working on a given task is not fully understood. Still, developers must make use of knowledge gleaned from all of this context to make decisions, coordinate their work, understand the purpose behind their tasks, and understand how their tasks fit with the rest of the project. The CSD workshop brings together scholars interested in identifying, gathering and modeling context information in software development, as well as discussing its applications.</p>
