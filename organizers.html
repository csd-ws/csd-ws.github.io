<strong>Daniela Damian</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/DanaHDamian" >@DanaHDamian</a>) is an Associate Professor in University of Victoria’s Department of Computer Science, where she leads research in the <a href="http://thesegalgroup.org" >Software Engineering Global interAction Laboratory (SEGAL)</a>. Her research interests include Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Empirical Software Engineering. Her recent work has studied the interplay of the social and technical aspects of developers’ coordination in large, geographically distributed software projects. Daniela has served on the program committee boards of several software engineering conferences, and was (co-)organizer on many workshops at ICSE, FSE and RE conferences. The Global Software Engineering Workshop she organized at ICSE in early 2000 was very successful and became the current International Conference on Global Software engineering (ICGSE) – of which first edition in 2006 she served as the program co-chair. She is currently serving on the editorial boards of the Journals of Transactions on Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering, and Software and Systems.

<strong>Giuseppe Valetto</strong> received a Laurea degree in Electronic Engineering from Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy in 1992, an MS in Computer Science from Columbia University, New York, NY, USA in 1994, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science, again from Columbia University, in 2004. In his career as a researcher, he has mostly worked on collaborative software engineering and distributed and self-adaptive systems. He has held positions as Xerox Research in Grenoble, France, CEFRIEL- Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, Telecom Italia Lab, Turin, Italy, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Hawthorne, NY, USA, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. He is currently a researcher in the Service Oriented Applications unit at Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy. He was the general chair of the IEEE Self- Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO) Conference in 2013.

<strong>James Herbsleb</strong> is a Professor in the Institute for Software Research in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he serves as Director of the PhD program in Computation, Organizations, and Society.  His research interests lie primarily in the intersection of software engineering, computer-supported cooperative work, and socio-technical systems, focusing on such areas as geographically distributed development teams and large-scale open source development. He holds a PhD in psychology, and an MS in computer science.
