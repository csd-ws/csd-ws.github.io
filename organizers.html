<strong>Daniela Damian</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/DanaHDamian" >@DanaHDamian</a>) is an Associate Professor in University of Victoria’s Department of Computer Science, where she leads research in the <a href="http://thesegalgroup.org" >Software Engineering Global interAction Laboratory (SEGAL)</a>. Her research interests include Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Empirical Software Engineering. Her recent work has studied the interplay of the social and technical aspects of developers’ coordination in large, geographically distributed software projects. Daniela has served on the program committee boards of several software engineering conferences, and was (co-)organizer on many workshops at ICSE, FSE and RE conferences. The Global Software Engineering Workshop she organized at ICSE in early 2000 was very successful and became the current International Conference on Global Software engineering (ICGSE) – of which first edition in 2006 she served as the program co-chair. She is currently serving on the editorial boards of the Journals of Transactions on Software Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering, and Software and Systems.
